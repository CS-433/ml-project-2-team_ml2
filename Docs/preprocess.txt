- Data augmentation :

	- Normalization
	- Standardization (after each C_l before each non-linearity fct)

	- Rotate / Flip (no resizing, less computation compared to rotation)
	- Crop ?
	- Lower resolution (max / mean pool)  --> Lower compuation time
	
	- Noise (Gaussian, shot, impulse) ?
	- Blur (Gaussian) ?
	- Change contrast, brightness ?
	
	- Sobel filtering (edge detection)
	
	 	-1 	-2 	-1 
	 	 0	 0 	 0
	 	 1	 2	 1
		
	- RBF , Kernel functions ?

- Preprocessing is the first part of the NN
